  abstract    = "As tumors grow, they acquire mutations, some of which create
                 neoantigens that influence the response of patients to immune
                 checkpoint inhibitors. We explored the impact of neoantigen
                 intratumor heterogeneity (ITH) on antitumor immunity. Through
                 integrated analysis of ITH and neoantigen burden, we
                 demonstrate a relationship between clonal neoantigen burden
                 and overall survival in primary lung adenocarcinomas.
                 CD8(+)tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes reactive to clonal
                 neoantigens were identified in early-stage non-small cell lung
                 cancer and expressed high levels of PD-1. Sensitivity to PD-1
                 and CTLA-4 blockade in patients with advanced NSCLC and
                 melanoma was enhanced in tumors enriched for clonal
                 neoantigens. T cells recognizing clonal neoantigens were
                 detectable in patients with durable clinical benefit.
                 Cytotoxic chemotherapy-induced subclonal neoantigens,
                 contributing to an increased mutational load, were enriched in
                 certain poor responders. These data suggest that neoantigen
                 heterogeneity may influence immune surveillance and support
                 therapeutic developments targeting clonal neoantigens.",

  abstract    = "Little is known about how RNA editing operates in cancer.
                 Transcriptome analysis of 68 normal and cancerous breast
                 tissues revealed that the editing enzyme ADAR acts uniformly,
                 on the same loci, across tissues. In controlled ADAR
                 expression experiments, the editing frequency increased at all
                 loci with ADAR expression levels according to the logistic
                 model. Loci-specific ``editabilities,'' i.e., propensities to
                 be edited by ADAR, were quantifiable by fitting the logistic
                 function to dose-response data. The editing frequency was
                 increased in tumor cells in comparison to normal controls.
                 Type I interferon response and ADAR DNA copy number together
                 explained 53\% of ADAR expression variance in breast cancers.
                 ADAR silencing using small hairpin RNA lentivirus transduction
                 in breast cancer cell lines led to less cell proliferation and
                 more apoptosis. A-to-I editing is a pervasive, yet
                 reproducible, source of variation that is globally controlled
                 by 1q amplification and inflammation, both of which are highly
                 prevalent among human cancers.",

                 tumorigenesis and have been the focus of much attention in
                 recent years. However, genetic content also may change farther
                 downstream. RNA editing alters the mRNA sequence from its
                 genomic blueprint in a dynamic and flexible way. A few
                 isolated cases of editing alterations in cancer have been
                 reported previously. Here, we provide a transcriptome-wide
                 characterization of RNA editing across hundreds of cancer
                 samples from multiple cancer tissues, and we show that A-to-I
                 editing and the enzymes mediating this modification are
                 significantly altered, usually elevated, in most cancer types.
                 Increased editing activity is found to be associated with

  abstract = "Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a clinically aggressive
              subtype of breast cancer commonly resistant to therapeutics that
              have been successful in increasing survival in ER+ and HER2+
              breast cancer patients. As such, identifying factors that
              contribute to poor patient outcomes and mediate the growth and
              survival of TNBC cells remain important areas of investigation.
              MTBP (MDM2 Binding Protein), a gene linked to cellular
              proliferation and a transcriptional target of the MYC oncogene,
              is over-expressed in human malignancies, yet its contribution to
              cancer remains unresolved. Evaluation of mRNA expression and copy
              number variation data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)
              revealed MTBP is commonly overexpressed in breast cancer and 19\%
              show amplification of MTBP. Increased transcript or gene
              amplification of MTBP significantly correlated with reduced
              breast cancer patient survival. Further analysis revealed that
              while MTBP mRNA is over-expressed in both ER+ and HER2+ breast
              cancers, its expression is highest in TNBC. MTBP mRNA and protein
              levels were also significantly elevated in a panel of human TNBC
              cell lines. Knockdown of MTBP in TNBC model systems induced
              apoptosis and significantly reduced TNBC cell growth and soft
              agar colony formation, which was rescued by expression of
              shRNA-resistant Mtbp. Notably, inducible knockdown of MTBP
              expression significantly impaired TNBC tumor growth, in vivo,
              including in established tumors. Thus, these data emphasize MTBP
              is important for the growth and survival of TNBC and warrants
              further investigation as a potential novel therapeutic target.
              Implications: MTBP significantly contributes to breast cancer
              survival and is a potential novel therapeutic target in TNBC.",

              and novel gene mutations including the enrichment of specific
              mutations in GATA3, PIK3CA and MAP3K1 with the luminal A subtype.
              We identified two novel protein-expression-defined subgroups,
              possibly produced by stromal/microenvironmental elements, and
              integrated analyses identified specific signalling pathways
              dominant in each molecular subtype including a
              HER2/phosphorylated HER2/EGFR/phosphorylated EGFR signature
              within the HER2-enriched expression subtype. Comparison of
              basal-like breast tumours with high-grade serous ovarian tumours
              showed many molecular commonalities, indicating a related
              aetiology and similar therapeutic opportunities. The biological
              finding of the four main breast cancer subtypes caused by
              different subsets of genetic and epigenetic abnormalities raises
              the hypothesis that much of the clinically observable plasticity
              and heterogeneity occurs within, and not across, these major
              biological subtypes of breast cancer.",

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Circos is a Perl language based software package for
              visualizing similarities and differences of genome structure and
              positional relationships between genomic intervals. Running
              Circos requires extra data processing procedures to prepare plot
              data files and configure files from datasets, which limits its
              capability of integrating directly with other software tools such
              as R. Recently published R Bioconductor package ggbio provides a
              function to display genomic data in circular layout based on
              multiple other packages, which increases its complexity of usage
              and decreased the flexibility in integrating with other R
              pipelines. RESULTS: We implemented an R package, RCircos, using
              only R packages that come with R base installation. The package
              supports Circos 2D data track plots such as scatter, line,
              histogram, heatmap, tile, connectors, links, and text labels.
              Each plot is implemented with a specific function and input data
              for all functions are data frames which can be objects read from
              text files or generated with other R pipelines. CONCLUSION:
              RCircos package provides a simple and flexible way to make Circos
              2D track plots with R and could be easily integrated into other R
              data processing and graphic manipulation pipelines for presenting
              large-scale multi-sample genomic research data. It can also serve

  abstract    = "BACKGROUND: Trellis graphics are a visualization method that
                 splits data by one or more categorical variables and displays
                 subsets of the data in a grid of panels. Trellis graphics are
                 broadly used in genomic data analysis to compare statistics
                 over different categories in parallel and reveal multivariate
                 relationships. However, current software packages to produce
                 Trellis graphics have not been designed with genomic data in
                 mind and lack some functionality that is required for
                 effective visualization of genomic data. RESULTS: Here we
                 introduce the gtrellis package which provides an efficient and
                 extensible way to visualize genomic data in a Trellis layout.
                 gtrellis provides highly flexible Trellis layouts which allow
                 efficient arrangement of genomic categories on the plot. It
                 supports multiple-track visualization, which makes it
                 straightforward to visualize several properties of genomic
                 data in parallel to explain complex relationships. In
                 addition, gtrellis provides an extensible framework that
                 allows adding user-defined graphics. CONCLUSIONS: The gtrellis
                 package provides an easy and effective way to visualize
                 genomic data and reveal high dimensional relationships on a
                 genome-wide scale. gtrellis can be flexibly extended and thus
                 can also serve as a base package for highly specific purposes.

                 public a large collection of clinical and molecular phenotypes
                 of more than 10 000 tumor patients across 33 different tumor
                 types. Using this cohort, TCGA has published over 20 marker
                 papers detailing the genomic and epigenomic alterations
                 associated with these tumor types. Although many important
                 discoveries have been made by TCGA's research network,
                 opportunities still exist to implement novel methods, thereby
                 elucidating new biological pathways and diagnostic markers.
                 However, mining the TCGA data presents several bioinformatics
                 challenges, such as data retrieval and integration with
                 clinical data and other molecular data types (e.g. RNA and DNA
                 methylation). We developed an R/Bioconductor package called
                 TCGAbiolinks to address these challenges and offer
                 bioinformatics solutions by using a guided workflow to allow
                 users to query, download and perform integrative analyses of
                 TCGA data. We combined methods from computer science and

                 developed in previous TCGA marker studies and in our own
                 group. Using four different TCGA tumor types (Kidney, Brain,

                 downloaded and prepared for subsequent steps. We have
                 developed an open source and extensible R based data client
                 for pre-processed data from the Firehouse, and demonstrate its
                 use with sample case studies. Results show that our
                 RTCGAToolbox can facilitate data management for researchers

                 of the fundamental data analysis tasks, especially for gene
                 expression studies, involves determining whether there is
                 evidence that counts for a transcript or exon are
                 significantly different across experimental conditions. edgeR
                 is a Bioconductor software package for examining differential
                 expression of replicated count data. An overdispersed Poisson
                 model is used to account for both biological and technical
                 variability. Empirical Bayes methods are used to moderate the
                 degree of overdispersion across transcripts, improving the
                 reliability of inference. The methodology can be used even
                 with the most minimal levels of replication, provided at least
                 one phenotype or experimental condition is replicated. The

              read counts from RNA-Seq gene expression studies. It provides the
              ability to analyse complex experiments involving multiple
              treatment conditions and blocking variables while still taking
              full account of biological variation. Biological variation
              between RNA samples is estimated separately from the technical
              variation associated with sequencing technologies. Novel
              empirical Bayes methods allow each gene to have its own specific
              variability, even when there are relatively few biological
              replicates from which to estimate such variability. The pipeline
              is implemented in the edgeR package of the Bioconductor project.
              A case study analysis of carcinoma data demonstrates the ability
              of generalized linear model methods (GLMs) to detect differential
              expression in a paired design, and even to detect tumour-specific
              expression changes. The case study demonstrates the need to allow
              for gene-specific variability, rather than assuming a common
              dispersion across genes or a fixed relationship between abundance
              and variability. Genewise dispersions de-prioritize genes with
              inconsistent results and allow the main analysis to focus on
              changes that are consistent between biological replicates.
              Parallel computational approaches are developed to make
              non-linear model fitting faster and more reliable, making the
              application of GLMs to genomic data more convenient and
              practical. Simulations demonstrate the ability of adjusted
              profile likelihood estimators to return accurate estimators of
              biological variability in complex situations. When variation is
              gene-specific, empirical Bayes estimators provide an advantageous
              compromise between the extremes of assuming common dispersion or
              separate genewise dispersion. The methods developed here can also
              be applied to count data arising from DNA-Seq applications,

                 between (replicated) conditions of RNA sequencing data relies
                 on counting reads that map to features of interest. Within
                 such count-based methods, many flexible and advanced
                 statistical approaches now exist and offer the ability to
                 adjust for covariates (e.g. batch effects). Often, these
                 methods include some sort of 'sharing of information' across
                 features to improve inferences in small samples. It is
                 important to achieve an appropriate tradeoff between
                 statistical power and protection against outliers. Here, we
                 study the robustness of existing approaches for count-based
                 differential expression analysis and propose a new strategy
                 based on observation weights that can be used within existing

                 experimental designs and for information borrowing to overcome
                 the problem of small sample sizes. Over the past decade, limma
                 has been a popular choice for gene discovery through
                 differential expression analyses of microarray and
                 high-throughput PCR data. The package contains particularly
                 strong facilities for reading, normalizing and exploring such
                 data. Recently, the capabilities of limma have been
                 significantly expanded in two important directions. First, the
                 package can now perform both differential expression and
                 differential splicing analyses of RNA sequencing (RNA-seq)
                 data. All the downstream analysis tools previously restricted
                 to microarray data are now available for RNA-seq as well.
                 These capabilities allow users to analyse both RNA-seq and
                 microarray data with very similar pipelines. Second, the
                 package is now able to go past the traditional gene-wise
                 expression analyses in a variety of ways, analysing expression
                 profiles in terms of co-regulated sets of genes or in terms of
                 higher-order expression signatures. This provides enhanced
                 possibilities for biological interpretation of gene expression
                 differences. This article reviews the philosophy and design of
                 the limma package, summarizing both new and historical

              genomics annotations and high-throughput data. The plots provide
              detailed views of genomic regions, summary views of sequence

              Bioconductor project. The plots are specified within a modular
              framework that enables users to construct plots in a systematic
              way, and are generated directly from Bioconductor data
              structures. The ggbio R package is available at

              and Brors, Benedikt",
  abstract = "SUMMARY: Circular layout is an efficient way for the
              visualization of huge amounts of genomic information. Here we
              present the circlize package, which provides an implementation of
              circular layout generation in R as well as an enhancement of
              available software. The flexibility of this package is based on
              the usage of low-level graphics functions such that self-defined
              high-level graphics can be easily implemented by users for
              specific purposes. Together with the seamless connection between
              the powerful computational and visual environment in R, circlize
              gives users more convenience and freedom to design figures for
              better understanding genomic patterns behind multi-dimensional
              data. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: circlize is available at
              the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN):

  abstract = "SUMMARY: OmicCircos is an R software package used to generate
              high-quality circular plots for visualizing genomic variations,
              including mutation patterns, copy number variations (CNVs),
              expression patterns, and methylation patterns. Such variations
              can be displayed as scatterplot, line, or text-label figures.
              Relationships among genomic features in different chromosome
              positions can be represented in the forms of polygons or curves.
              Utilizing the statistical and graphic functions in an
              R/Bioconductor environment, OmicCircos performs statistical
              analyses and displays results using cluster, boxplot, histogram,
              and heatmap formats. In addition, OmicCircos offers a number of
              unique capabilities, including independent track drawing for easy
              modification and integration, zoom functions, link-polygons, and
              position-independent heatmaps supporting detailed visualization.
              AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: OmicCircos is available through
              Bioconductor at
              http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/devel/bioc/html/OmicCircos.html.
              An extensive vignette in the package describes installation, data
              formatting, and workflow procedures. The software is open source
