  abstract    = "The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) is one of the most ambitious
                 and successful cancer genomics programs to date. The TCGA
                 program has generated, analyzed, and made available genomic
                 sequence, expression, methylation, and copy number variation
                 data on over 11,000 individuals who represent over 30
                 different types of cancer. This chapter provides a brief
                 overview of the TCGA program and detailed instructions and
                 tips for investigators on how to find, access, and download
